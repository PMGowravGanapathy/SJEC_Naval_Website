          <p>Our mission is to instill a sense of duty towards the nation and its defense forces 
            by training cadets in various naval operations. The SJEC Naval NCC Wing offers rigorous 
            training programs that emphasize naval disciplines, personal character development, and  
             community service. Through participation in this wing, students are encouraged to embody
              the core values of courage, commitment, and service to the nation.</p>

          <h4 class="alert-heading">Training and Activities</h4>
          <p>Cadets at SJEC undergo comprehensive training in seamanship, navigation, ship modeling, 
            and naval communications. Specialized training in sailing, boating, and scuba diving gives 
            cadets hands-on experience in maritime skills, which sets the Naval Wing apart. Cadets are 
            also trained in drill, physical fitness, weapon handling, and first aid, helping them stay 
            fit and ready for any challenge. These trainings are designed not only to prepare cadets for 
            a potential career in the armed forces but also to build essential life skills like resilience, 
            leadership, and teamwork.</p>

          <p>Beyond the physical and technical skills, SJEC Naval NCC Wing focuses heavily on developing leadership
             qualities and team spirit. Each cadet is encouraged to take up roles of responsibility, and through various 
             leadership challenges, they learn to make quick decisions, manage teams, and handle stressful situations effectively. 
             These qualities not only help cadets in NCC but also in their personal and professional lives, shaping them 
             into well-rounded individuals ready to face future challenges.</p>

          <p>The SJEC Naval NCC Wing is also deeply committed to giving back to society. Our cadets engage in community service 
            programs, such as cleanliness drives, environmental awareness campaigns, and disaster relief efforts, contributing 
            positively to the local and national community. This community service instills a sense of social responsibility and 
            humanitarian values in every cadet.</p>

          <p>Being part of the Naval NCC Wing opens up numerous opportunities for cadets. Many go on to secure scholarships,
             attend international exchange programs, or even join the prestigious Indian Armed Forces. The B and C certificates
              awarded to cadets are highly valued and can serve as stepping stones for a career in defense services, giving students 
              an edge in various competitive exams like the Combined Defense Services (CDS) and SSB interviews.</p>
